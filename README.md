# Skip Google paid tracking

Recently I went to more than one place where extremely closed Pi-hole setups disable googleadservices.com by DNS blocking. This led to all paid results in google not working as they go through a tracking system. This Chrome extension skips the URL masquerading that happens when you click a link. This restores the navigation and nobody complains anymore ;-)

This project is not meant for production and should not be forked to be put in the store as it probably violates the google search terms.
